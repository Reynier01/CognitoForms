## Cognito Forms -- Using Amazon Cognito from Xamarin Forms

This is an example project showing how to connect to Amazon Cognito using Xamarin Forms. 

You can test against the user pool referenced in the sample code. This sample pool requires that the user name be an email. After registering, check the email to get a link for validating the account. (You can configure your Cognito with a different set of requirements.)

Alternatively, you can log in with a userid of <code>testit@saltydogtechnology.com</code> and password of: <code>Cognito_2018</code>
